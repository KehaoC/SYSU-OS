# SYSU-OS

> Footprints along with learning the operating system course in Sun Yet-sen University.

For that the lesson penal only put off the tutorial on x86 architecture, and some dudes just only have arm architecture such as Macbook M*, which make it difficult for them to learn the code directly from the different tutorial. Thus,  this repo born.

Feel free to commit pull-request, appreciate it!

> This tutorial only includes parts distinguised from the oringinal tutorial. As a result, eat with https://gitee.com/nelsoncheung/sysu-2023-spring-operating-system/tree/main would be better!

> And the stucture of this repo will keep pace with the oringinal tutorial.
